# Project Sourcebound Dev Journal

## Apr 2, 2025 - 5 hours

### Objective(s)

1. To understand the game itself and prepare for designing my own implementation.
2. To setup repo and some initial documents for managing efforts.
### Details

#### Key Accomplishments

* Completed extensive reading of materials about Arkanoid
* Spent about 1-1.5 hours playing the original(?) and a clone online
* Got a project page and repo setup, and generated some initial documentation of my current research findings

#### Challenges / Notes

* My first time using Github Projects, but wanted to experiment with it, and have some tie between it and the repo itself.
* There's a LOT of research material out there, so I won't be able to absorb it all, but hoping I have a strong foundation for beginning design elements; not sure I will update the document more, but I dated it just in case.

#### Next Steps

* Add decisions.md file for detailing design and tool decisions.
* Begin work on high-level design documents.
